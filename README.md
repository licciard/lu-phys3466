# PHYS3466 MathPhys Methods at LU (Winter 2021)

The Jupyter notebooks I introduced at the MathPhys course at Laurentian University during the Winter 2021 semester.

- This course covers complex numbers, complex (Cauchy) analysis and then Fourier analysis. 

- The notebooks are aimed at Fourier series, transforms and convolutions.
